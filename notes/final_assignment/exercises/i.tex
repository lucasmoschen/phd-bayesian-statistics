    {\bf Solution.} I use {\em Stan} platform with {\em PyStan} interface for
    {\em Python programming language}. The problem is it does not handle
    unbounded discrete parameters. Therefore we use the approach suggested in
    the documentation \cite{stan} considering the population size a continuous
    variable. I tried to use the package {\em PyMC3} for this model (this
    package handles the discrete parameter), but given convergence problems,
    we do not present the results.
