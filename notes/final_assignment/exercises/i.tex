    {\bf Solution.} I use {\em Stan} platform with {\em PyStan} interface for
    {\em Python programming language}. The problem is that it does not handle
    unbounded discrete parameters. Therefore we use the approach suggested in
    the documentation \cite{stan} considering the population size a continuous
    variable. I tried to use the package {\em PyMC3} for this model (this
    package handles discrete parameters), but given convergence problems,
    I do not present the results. 
    
    \hspace{6mm} As I will present posteriorly, this problem
    may be related to the sampler Metropolis. For the Geometric and
    independent approach, it is possible to compare the analytic curve with
    Stan result (considering $N$ a real variable), and Stan got a well
    approximate result, while PyMC3 had convergence problems.

    \hspace{6mm} In Figures XXX and YYY, I sketch the marginal posterior
    distributions for each approach and each data set. In table XXX, it is
    shown the Bayes estimator under quadratic loss (the expected value
    \cite[Section 4]{Robert2007}), under loss \ref{eq:relative_loss}, and 95\%
    credibility interval.
