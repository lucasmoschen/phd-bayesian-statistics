    {\bf Solution.} The structure of the Geometric independent approach
    allowed the closed-form marginalization over $\nu$ and $\theta$, as expressed in
    equation \ref{eq:p1-geom-indep}. I will denote from now on $p_4$ the
    marginalized distribution of Geometric correlated approach, given by
    expression \ref{eq:p1-geom-corr}.
